                            Welcome to my portfolio web site! This site is meant to showcase the web development skills and experience of Gary Smith. So who is Kahuna Coder then? Well, Kahuna Coder is my on line handle. I created it to differentiate myself from the millions of other Gary Smith's on line. Having lived in Hawaii for 35+ years I used a Hawaiian word in my handle that means among other things an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahuna">"expert in any profession"</a>. It's interesting how the other meanings of kahuna are "priest, sorcerer, magician, wizard, minister". I think the work of most experts can appear magical to the laymen.

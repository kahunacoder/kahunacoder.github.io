                    <p>In February of 2009 Tsunami Marketing laid me off because of lack of work. I've since started <strong>freelancing</strong> and I'm now offering my extensive web development capabilities to other <strong>creative professionals</strong> and <strong>web site owners</strong>. I am <strong><u>not a designer</u></strong>, I am a <strong><u>web developer</u></strong>.</p>

                    <p>If you have a web site you would like to build and have the graphics and architecture for it I can build it for you. If you're an <strong>advertising agency</strong> or a <strong>designer</strong> and you would like to <strong>leverage</strong> your <strong>existing talents</strong> by offering your clients a website that matches their <strong>brand</strong> then you can <strong>outsource</strong> the web development to me.</p>

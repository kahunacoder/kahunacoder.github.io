This project features information about festivals on Kauai. This is a complete update of their previous site that I built in **2004**. The new site features a **simpler navigation system** and **larger images** to reflect the **larger monitors** and **higher resolutions** that are used by **modern web surfers**.

The site was built using my customized **Zend Framework**. It uses **Blueprint CSS**, **Smarty Templates**, **ADODB**, **jQuery**, **Pear** and **HTML_Quickforms**.

The *Kauai Festivals* web site features a **floating navigation panel** on the **front-end** and a **custom made CMS** which allows festival editors to edit information about their festivals and the **web master** has an **interface** for approving the festivals and **assigning editors** for each festival.

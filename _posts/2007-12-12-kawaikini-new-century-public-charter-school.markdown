This site uses a **CMS** based on **smarty** conf files. The **site editor** can log in via **ch-rooted ftp** and **edit** the conf **files** that create the site. Each page has a Hawaiian version and an English version. **SIFR** is used for the headline of each page and allows for changes to be made in the conf files as English and Hawaiian text.The page displays a **flash image** of the text in a font that isn't a **web font**. A **jQuery plugin** is used to add shadows to images uploaded by the **site editor**.

Around Hawaii is a **portal** site for Oceanic Time-Warner. This site features **rounded corners** and **css sprites** and a **tabbed navigation system**. Editors can add **widgets** to any page or page **template** using a **drag and drop** interface via **ajax** magic. It's basically a **custom blog** where editors can **upload content** and **members** can **comment** on **articles**. This site was built with my **custom framework** which uses **smarty** and **mod rewrite**.

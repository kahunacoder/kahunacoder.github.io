This is a **portal site** for *Oceanic Time-Warner*. This site features **rounded corners** and **css sprites** and a **tabbed navigation system**. Editors can **add widgets** to any **page** or **page template** using a **drag and drop interface** via **ajax magic**. Itâ€™s basically a **custom blog** where editors can **upload content** and members can **comment** on **articles**. This site was built with **my custom framework** which uses **smarty** and **mod rewrite**.

Scott Hollinger RE/MAX of Bigfork wanted a **redesign** to take advantage of **larger monitor sizes** and **higher resolutions**. The site features a unique way to **search** for property, Scott's listings are shown on a **map** of the area with **colored push pins** which can be **rolled over** to view more details or **clicked** on to display all the details. The search area is**embedded** in an **iframe** and has **tabs** for searching by **map** or **form**. Users can **save** their favorite properties for easy viewing. All data is updated from their local mls service. My **custom framework** using **smarty** and **mod-rewrite** for **SEO** enhancements was used create a **easy to maintain** site and **reduce code redundancy**.

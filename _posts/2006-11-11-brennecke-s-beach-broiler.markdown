This site features a **e-commerce section** which allows them to sell **logo wear** and **merchandise**. The **pull down menus** are **dynamic** and use **javascript** so choosing a size populates the colors menu with only colors that are available for that size. Items can be added to their **custom shopping cart** for checkout later or they can **checkout** right from their **cart**. This site was built with **my custom framework** which uses **MVC** to **separate code**, **reduce redundancy** and make the site **easier to update and maintain**. This site also uses **mod-rewrite** to create **SEO friendly** urls.

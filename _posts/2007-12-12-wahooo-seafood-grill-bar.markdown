**Wahooo Seafood Grill & Bar** was a new site for this Kapa'a restaurant. The **navigation** features a **pull down fly out menu** using **jQuery**. All menu items are update via **smarty** conf files. There is a **CMS** for adding items to the merchandise section. The merchandise section uses **javascript** to **populate pull down menus** based on selections made in **other pull down menus**. So choosing a color only shows sizes available in that color. A **shopping cart** is **implemented** to allow customers to **purchase** logo wear **online**. Checkout is done via a **secure server** and **PayPal's Website Payments Pro** is used for the **credit card processing**. **Express checkout** is also implemented to allow **PayPal** clients to checkout as well.

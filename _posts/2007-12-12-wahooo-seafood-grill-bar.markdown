They needed a new site for this *Kapa’a* restaurant. The **navigation** features a **pull down fly out menu** using **jQuery**. All menu items are update via **smarty conf** files. There is a **CMS** for adding items to the **merchandise section**. The merchandise section uses **javascript** to populate **pull down menus based on selections** made in other **pull down menus**. So choosing a color only shows sizes available in that color. A **shopping cart** is **implemented** to allow customers to **purchase** logo wear **online**. Checkout is done via a **secure server** and **PayPal’s Website Payments Pro** is used for the **credit card processing**. **Express checkout** is also **implemented** to allow **PayPal clients** to checkout as well.

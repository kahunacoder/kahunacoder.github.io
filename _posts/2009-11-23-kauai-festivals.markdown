This site features information about festivals on Kauai. This is a complete **update** of their previous site that I built in **2004**. The new site features a **simpler navigation** system and **larger images** to reflect the larger **monitors** and higher **resolutions** that are used by **modern web surfers**.



The site was built using my customized **Zend Framework**. It uses **Blueprint Css**, **smarty**, **adodb**, **jquery**, **pear** and **HTML Quickforms**.



The Kauai Festivals web site features a **floating navigation panel** on the front-end and a custom made **CMS** which allows festival **editors** to edit information about their festivals and the **web master** has an **interface** for approving the festivals and **assigning editors** for each festival.

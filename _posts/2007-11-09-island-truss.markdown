Their website’s designer wanted to use a **stencil style font** which is unavailable to most users. The site content is **dynamic** and **editable** through a **custom CMS**. Creating graphics for all the text elements using the **stencil fon**t was not practical. Enter **sIFR**, **sIFR** is a technique that **replaces text elements** on a page with **flash graphics** set with the specified **font and size**. Thanks to a **jQuery plugin**, **sIFR** was easy to **implement**. The site also features a **tab navigation system** that loads section **pages**. There are **gallery pages** to showcase their truss designs and projects. The gallery images display an **inline popup window** when they are **rolled over**. Like all of our **contact forms** I use a **spam prevention filter** that doesn’t require the user to prove they are human **(captcha)**.

Tsunami Marketing wanted to **redesign** their website to take advantage of users **larger monitors** to showcase their **great designs**. There are lots of **layers** and **javascript** used to create a **interactive site** that encourages users to **view the next page**. The site features **navigation thumbnails** that entice the visitor to click on them. An **animated graphic** is used as a **background layer** and displayed while the next graphic is **loaded on-demand** to increase the **speed** at which the **page loads**. The pages are **centered** **vertically** and **horizontally** on the page with a **fixed width** and **height**.

A **CMS** is used on the back-end to allow Tsunami Staff to update the site without having to know **HTML**. **Images** are **cropped** and or **re-sized** and **thumbnails** are **created** using **ImageMagick** to ensure the sites layout is maintained.

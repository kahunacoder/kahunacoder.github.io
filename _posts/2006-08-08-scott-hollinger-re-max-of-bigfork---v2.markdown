Scott wanted a **redesign** to take advantage of **larger monitor sizes** and **higher resolutions**. The site features a unique way to **search for property**, *Scotts* listings are shown on a **map** of the area with **colored push pins** which can be **rolled over** to view **more details** or **clicked on** to display **all the details**. The **search area** is **embedded** in an **iframe** and has **tabs** for **searching** by **map** or **form**. Users can **save** their **favorite properties** for easy viewing. All **data** is **updated** from their **local mls service**. **My custom framework** using **smarty** and **mod-rewrite** for **SEO enhancements** was used create a **easy to maintain site** and **reduce code redundancy**.

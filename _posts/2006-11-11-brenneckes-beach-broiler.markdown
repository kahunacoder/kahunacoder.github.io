Brennecke's Beach Broiler site features a **e-commerce** section which allows them to **sell** logo wear and **merchandise**. The **pull down menus** are **dynamic** and use **javascript** so choosing a size populates the colors menu with only colors that are available for that size. Items can be added to their **custom shopping cart** for checkout later or they can checkout right from their **cart**. This site was built with my** custom framework** which uses **MVC** to separate code reduce redundancy and make the site easier to update and maintain. This site also uses **mod-rewrite** to create **SEO** friendly url's.

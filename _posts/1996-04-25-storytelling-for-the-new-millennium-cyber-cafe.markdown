This site was developed for the *Kauai Film Commission*, which was sponsoring this event, to introduce **Internet** technologies to writers, artists, musicans, film makers and other story tellers. 

The site features **background patterns**, **tables**, **animated gifs**, and the *Netscape* **center tag**. People attending the workshops were loaned **digital cameras** and given a space on the website to write their own story. Once their page was approved it was **uploaded live** during the conference. I also functioned as **webmaster** for this event.

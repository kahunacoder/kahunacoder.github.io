I would of liked to have [Tsunami Marketing](http://www.tsunamimarketing.com/) **design** my site but I really couldn't afford them and I didn't want to have to build the **front-end** and a **CMS** as well. Robert, my former boss, was experimenting with **Wordpress** and found it to be quite good. That's a **huge endorsement** coming from him since his **designs** are usually quite **challenging** to **build**. I was sure if he could live with any of the **limitations imposed** by **off the shelf software** so could I. I also thought it would be a great way to learn **Wordpress** so I could use it in **future projects**. I quickly found out how **flexible** **Wordpress** is without any **coding**. With my **existing capabilities** and **skills** I found I could do just about **anything** I wanted to a **web site**. **Wordpress** and **Zend Framework** are now my **tools of choice** when creating **new sites**.



I built this site using **Wordpress** as a **CMS**. I used **PHP**, **HTML** and **CSS** to customize it. **Not** being a **designer** it was easy to build this using a **theme** and then **modifying** it. The **screen captures** of the **sites** I've done really **stand out** against this **themes** **neutral colors**.



I like the many **plugins**, **widgets** and **themes** that are available for **Wordpress** allowing you to **customize** the look and add **functionality** to the site without having to directly **edit** the **code**.

This [Poipu Beach Resort Association](http://www.poipubeach.org/) website was a **redesign** of their site built in 1999. The site was built to take advantage of the **larger** **monitors** and **resolutions** enjoyed by web surfers today. The custom **CMS** was updated to allow the site editor to place **teaser widgets** on specific pages. There is also a **weather widget** which displays the current conditions and a **search widget**. **jQuery** is used for the **pull down navigation** and **inline popup windows**. There is a map section that uses **goggle maps** and a **pull down menu** to show you where members and places of interest are located. Member listings also feature a link to the **dynamic map** section. The **contact form** uses a **filter** to **prevent robots** from using the form to send **spam**. The filter eliminates the need for users to fill in **captcha's**.** **

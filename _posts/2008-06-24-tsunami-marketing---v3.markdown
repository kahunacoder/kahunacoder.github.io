They wanted to redesign their website to take advantage of users **larger monitors** to showcase their great designs. There are lots of **layers** and **javascript** used to create a **interactive site** that encourages users to view the next page. The site features **navigation thumbnails** that entice the visitor to click on them. An **animated graphic** is used as a **background layer** and displayed while the next graphic is **loaded on-demand** to increase the **speed at which the page loads**. The pages are centered **vertically and horizontally** on the page with a **fixed width and height**.

A **CMS** is used on the **back-end** to allow Tsunami Staff to update the site without having to know **HTML**. Images are **cropped** and or **re-sized** and **thumbnails** are created using **ImageMagick** to ensure the sites **layout** is maintained.

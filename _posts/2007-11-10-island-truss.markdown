The [Island Truss](http://www.islandtruss.com/) website's designer wanted to use a stencil style **font** which is unavailable to most users. The site **content** is **dynamic** and **editable** through a custom **CMS**. Creating graphics for all the text elements using the stencil font was not practical. Enter [sIFR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Inman_Flash_Replacement), **sIFR** is a technique that replaces text elements on a page with **flash graphics** set with the specified font and size. Thanks to a **jQuery** plugin, **sIFR** was easy to implement. The site also features a **tab navigation system** that loads section pages. There are **gallery pages** to showcase their truss designs and projects. The gallery images display an **inline popup window** when they are **rolled over**. Like all of our contact forms I use a **spam prevention filter** that doesn't require the user to prove they are human (**captcha**).

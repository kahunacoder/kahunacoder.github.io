This site uses a **custom CMS** based on **smarty conf files**. The site editor can log in via **ch-rooted ftp** and edit the **conf files** that create the site. Each page has a **Hawaiian version** and an **English version**. **SIFR** is used for the **headline** of each page and allows for changes to be made in the **conf files** as English and Hawaiian text.The page displays a **flash image** of the text in a font that isnâ€™t a **web font**. A **jQuery plugin** is used to **add shadows to images** uploaded by the site editor.

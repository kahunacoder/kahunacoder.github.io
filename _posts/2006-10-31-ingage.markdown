Ingage is one of the most complicated sites I've ever built. It's a **member site** where members can be either a protege or a mentor or both. The Ingage Zone section of the site is where all the magic happens. Mentors and proteges interact with each other using a **series of forms** to **schedule assignments**, **track time usage**, **uploadmaterials**, **update their profiles** and **manage their accounts**.

The **e-commerce** section of the site allows proteges to **purchase** courses via a custom **PayPal integration** that uses **PayPal IPN** to provide instant access. Unfortunately the e-commerce section is currently brokenafter a server move.

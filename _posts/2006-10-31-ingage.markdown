This was one of the most complicated sites I’ve ever built. It’s a **member site** where members can be either a **protege** or a **mentor** or **both**. The *Ingage Zone* section of the site is where all the **magic** happens. Mentors and proteges **interact** with each other using a series of **forms** to **schedule assignments**, **track time usage**, **upload materials**, **update their profiles** and **manage their accounts**.

The **e-commerce** section of the site allows proteges to **purchase courses** via a **custom PayPal integration** that uses **PayPal IPN** to provide **instant access**.

This site was the first **ecommerce site** I developed. It used **cgi-bin** and a **perl** script to total the items and send an **email** to the client. This wasn't a true **shopping cart**, when you selected an item it took you to a **form** which listed all the items for sale. 

We **upgraded** the site to use **mini-vend.pl**, a **perl** script that provided a more **modern shopping cart** experience, and then, when the project was nearing completion, we had a problem because **mini-vend** didn't support **netsite server maps**. We were able to salvage the project by **cutting up the graphics** and adding them into **cells** to the newly introduced *Netscape* **table tags**.
